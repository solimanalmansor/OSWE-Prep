# DotNetNuke Cookie Deserialization RCE
This module covered the analysis and exploitation of a deserialization vulnerability in the .NET DNN application.These types of vulnerabilities are most often found in PHP or Java based applications.However, as weâ€™ve demonstrated in this module, .NET applications can suffer fromthis vulnerability class as well, and the impact can be significant.
## Introduction
Serialization is the process of converting structured data into a format that can be stored in a file or database, or transmitted over a network. Typically, serialization involves a producer and a consumer of the serialized data structure or object.
We will focus on the `XMLSerializer` class, as it is directly related to the vulnerability covered in this module. As the name suggests, the `XMLSerializer` class stores the state of an object in XML format.

**[Limitations:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/introducing-xml-serialization#items-that-can-be-serialized)**
- `XmlSerializer` class can only serialize public fields and property values of an object.
- `XmlSerializer` class supports a narrow set of object types, primarily due to the fact that it cannot serialize abstract classes:
  - `XmlElement` objects.
  - `XmlNode` objects.
  - `DataSet` objects.
- the type of the object being serialized must always be known to the `XmlSerializer` instance at runtime.
