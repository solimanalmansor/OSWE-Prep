## ManageEngine SQLI to RCE
In this module we have demonstrated how to discover an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability using source code audit in a Java-based web application.
We then showed how to use time-based blind SQL injection payloads along with stack queries in order to exfiltrate database information.
Finally, we developed an exploit that utilized Postgres User Defined Functions and Large Objects to gain a fully functional reverse shell.
